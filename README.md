# puppet-wal_e

[![Puppet Forge](http://img.shields.io/puppetforge/v/jdowning/wal_e.svg)](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/jdowning/wal_e) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/justindowning/puppet-wal_e.png)](https://travis-ci.org/justindowning/puppet-wal_e)

## Description

This Puppet module will install and manage [wal-e](https://github.com/wal-e/wal-e) for PostgreSQL.

## Usage

**This module is still being fleshed out and has only been tested with Ubuntu. It is also opinionated in that it expects PostgreSQL to be installed on the host machine.**

If you are using the Puppet Labs PostgreSQL module, you can configure WAL-E as such:

    class { 'postgresql::server': }->
    class { 'wal_e':
      access_key => 'foo',
      secret_key => 'bar',
      s3_prefix  => 's3://bucket/folder',
    }

## Testing

Like the module, the `Vagrantfile` is opinionated. You will need to pass a `PUPPET_HOME` variable with the directory to the following Puppet Labs modules:
* apt
* concat
* firewall
* postgresql
* stdlib

For example, `PUPPET_HOME=~/path/to/puppet vagrant up` will start a Ubuntu box and setup WAL-E.
